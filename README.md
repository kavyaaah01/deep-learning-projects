Overview

This project involves developing a stock price prediction model using advanced deep learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast future stock prices. The model predicts prices for the next four months and evaluates accuracy using various performance metrics.

 Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, feature scaling, and time series transformation.

Deep Learning Model: Implemented LSTM for time-series forecasting to predict stock prices.

Ensemble Methods: Applied stacking and boosting techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

Feature Engineering: Integrated technical indicators and alternative data sources for enhanced predictions.

Model Evaluation: Performed backtesting with walk-forward optimization; evaluated with MAE, MSE, and R² metrics.

Visualization: Plotted actual vs. predicted stock prices, including future predictions.
